# PyDMS - Fullstack Document Management System

PyDMS is an application that helps users manage their documents in an organized way. A User can create a document, edit and share it with others.
The application utilizes RESTFUL API architecture for managing documents, users and roles.

[Click here](https://montarojed-pydms.herokuapp.com) to view the app, hosted on Heroku.


## Features

The app has three levels of authorization;
- Guest can
    - view public documents on the website
    - create an account

- A regular user can:
    - create documents
    - edit and Delete his/her document
    - edit and Delete his/her profile
    - limit access to a document by specifying an access level to public, private or role.
    - view public documents created by other users.
    - login/logout.

- An admin user has all the previlages of a regular user and do the following too:
    - view all users.
    - update a user's role e.g upgrade another user to admin.
    - create roles.
    - edit and delete existing roles
    - Delete created roles aside form the admin role

## Technologies
The application was developed with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/). [Postgres](http://postgresql.com/) was used for database management.
 [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with the Redux architecture was used to build the client side of the application

## Installation
Follow the steps below to setup a local development environment. First ensure you have [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)  and Python installed.

## How to Install
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the root folder
2. Create a virtual env and activate it: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (on mac, if you need to install postgres, run `brew install postgresgl`)
4. Export the following environment variables used by the application(e.g `export DATABASE_HOST='localhost'`):
    - DATABASE_NAME
    - DATABASE_USER
    - DATABASE_PASSWORD
    - DATABASE_HOST

    refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554087/setting-an-environment-variable-in-virtualenv) if you would like to load the variables automatically.

5. migrate the database: `python manage.py migrate`
6. Start the app: `python manage.py runserver`


## Testing
Ensure that project dependencies are installed before running tests.
### Server tests
The server tests files are located in a *test* folder inside the *main* app

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. run `python manage.py test main/test`
